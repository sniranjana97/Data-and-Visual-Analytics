Values of calculated metrics:

Average Node Degree: Degree is number of edges incident on a node. Average degree is mean of degrees of all the nodes in the graph.
Value: 1.58

Diameter of the graph: Diameter is longest path in a graph. In other words, it is the maximum number of edges between any two nodes in a graph.
Value: 8

Average path length: Path length is minimum number of edges between two nodes. Average path length is the mean of path lengths between every two nodes in a graph.
Value: 2.621
